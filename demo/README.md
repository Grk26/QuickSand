This demo project shows how you can integrate your animations and transitions with Quicksand.

It is comprised of 4 packages:

activitytransition

    Shows Quicksand integration with transitions you use to animate between two activities.

amazetransition

    Shows Quicksand integration when you have a complex custom animation of your own creation.

viewanimation

    Shows Quicksand integration when using ViewPropertyAnimator and chaining animations

simpleanimation

    Shows Quicksand integration when using ViewPropertyAnimator

Each animation you create is controlled by a Viscosity, this class determines how the animation duration changes over time.
If you look in DemoApplication.java you can toggle different Viscosities for the demo animations.
